SUMMARY
When you open Kaikoon, you first see a quick logo screen, and then you go through a simple two-step setup that asks for your grade and which classes you take. After that, you land on the main to-do list, where you can see your current Kaibloom points, any tasks you’ve added, and a big plus button at the bottom. When you tap the plus button, you type in your task and tap “Break into steps.” The app uses ChatGPT to suggest smaller sub-tasks and the materials you’ll need. You set how many minutes you think the entire task will take, save it, and instantly see the task appear on your list.

Tapping a task brings up its step-by-step checklist and a timer. You can start, pause, or reset the timer as you work through each sub-task. Once you’ve checked off every step and stopped the timer, a “Finish” button appears. When you press “Finish,” you pick an emoji to show how you feel, write a short reflection, and the app labels your text as positive, neutral, or negative. You immediately earn Kaibloom points, see a “Great job” message, and return to the main list, ready to add or tackle the next task.

MAIN PROBLEM
Neurodivergent teens often forget materials, miss the right moment to start a task, and abandon homework halfway through because executive-function skills are difficult to manage on their own.

MAIN SOLUTION
Kaikoon works like a mobile micro-coach that turns everyday school prep and study sessions into short, reward-based missions.

APP FLOW
Splash logo, first-time setup, main to-do screen, add a task, work on it, reflect, then back to the main screen.

SCREENS AND WHAT HAPPENS ON THEM
Splash: shows the Kaikoon logo.
First-time setup: choose your school grade, pick your classes, then tap “Done” to go to the main screen.
Main screen: at the top you see your Kaibloom counter and a list of your tasks, with a big plus button in the corner to add a new one.
Add Task: type your task into the text box, tap “Break into steps,” enter how many minutes you think it will take, and tap “Save.”
Task detail screen: shows the smaller steps with checkboxes and the timer you set. When all steps are checked and you stop the timer, a “Finish task” button appears.
Reflection pop-up: pick one of five heart-face emojis to show how you feel, write a short answer to “How did it go,” and tap “Analyze my text.” The app then adds 15 Kaiblooms to your balance.
Settings: change your grade or classes, turn bigger text or a haptic buzz on or off, and clear all data.

WHAT THE APP SAVES
– A task title, estimated minutes, the list of steps, and whether it is done.
– Each step’s done or not-done status and any required materials.
– The reflection emoji, your text, and its positive, neutral, or negative label.
– Your total Kaibloom points.
